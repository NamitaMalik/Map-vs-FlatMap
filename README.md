# Map VS FlatMap

Anyone who has worked upon/read about **RXJS** must be aware about various operators that this library includes, some of them are:

1. **0f** - It simply converts a list of arguments into an **Observable** sequence.
2. **from** - Creates an **Observable** sequence from an array or an object that can be iterated.
3. **map** - Transforms each element of the **Observable** sequence. Can be considered similar to **map** function of **Array**.
4. **subscribe** - This operator is basically the connecting point between an **Observer** and **Observable**. An **Observer** receives item/error/completion notification from 
    **Observable** using the **subscribe** operator. A **cold observable** would start emitting value only when an **observer** subscribes to it. 

The above ones are like most commonly used and you would get to know many new ones. 

Well, I encountered a situation where I had **Observable** of **Observables** and I wanted a single stream out of them and to solve this I got introduced to another interesting operator:

**flatMap** - It basically **merges an observable sequence of observable sequences into a single observable sequence.**

So, let's take a sample snippet to see how the it works. We have an array of visitors as given below:

```TypeScript
var visitors = [
    "Namita",
    "Amit",
    "Rohit",
    "Neetika"
];
```

Now, we want this array to be converted into an **Observable** sequence, so it can be done something like:

```TypeScript 
var source = Rx.Observable.from(visitors)
    .map(x => 'Hello ' + x);
```

We will now have to subscribe to this sequence:

```TypeScript
source.subscribe(x => document.getElementById('flatMap').innerText += x + "\n");
```

And view would look like this:

But what we wanted to see was how to work with **observable of observable sequence**, so for that let's make some changes as given below:

```TypeScript
var source = Rx.Observable.from(visitors)
    .map(x => Rx.Observable.of('Hello ' + x));
```

... and our view would look something like this:

![Map-error.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamitaMalik/Map-vs-FlatMap/master/assets/Map-error.png)

So how to fix this up? Well, now we'll have to use our **flatMap** operator as given below:

```TypeScript
var source = Rx.Observable.from(visitors)
    .flatMap(x => Rx.Observable.of('Hello ' + x));
```

and now one can simply subscribe to it as we were doing earlier and our view as per our expectations:

![map-flatMap.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamitaMalik/Map-vs-FlatMap/master/assets/map-flatMap.png)

So what's the exact difference between **map** and **flatMap**:

**map** transforms items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item whereas **flatmap**:

1. Applies a specified function to each emitted item and this function in turn returns an Observable for each item.
2. flatMap then merges all these sequences to make a new sequence.
    
So let's make a small ASCII marbel to make our understanding more clear:
  
```TypeScript
----Namita---Amit---Rohit---Neetika----- //Input Stream
.map(x => 'Hello ' + x);
---Hello Namita---Hello Amit---Hello Rohit---Hello Neetika--- //Map's function result
```  
  
```TypeScript
----Namita---Amit---Rohit---Neetika----- //Input Stream
.flatMap(x => Rx.Observable.of('Hello ' + x))
--Hello Namita--     //transforming each input element into an Observable
--Hello Amit--
--Hello Rohit--
--Hello Neetika--
---Hello Namita---Hello Amit---Hello Rohit---Hello Neetika--- // Flatmap's final result
```

There is also another operator named as **.mergeAll** which we can use with **map** when we are in observable of observables situation instead of directly using **flatMap**. **RxJS** has numerous operators and hopefully this learning
voyage will take us to each one of them.. till then happy learning!
